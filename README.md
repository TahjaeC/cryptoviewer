cryptoviewer

This is my second vue project. I used a free API provided by Nomics (Nomics Cryptocurrency & Bitcoin API (1.0.0)). This simple web application fetches information on various cryptocurrencies. I had intended to include a search function but the free API does not allow filtering. I had also intended to display the data in a paginated format but I got lazy and moved on to another project ;).

I would like to say thanks to: 

Stephen Grider for his Udemy course on Vue

Nomics for their free API

Stackoverflow named "tao". I had some issues with loading the spinner and this user gave me a detailed solution

A youtube channel called "OnlineTutorials" for his CSS glass effect tutorial

Whitout these individuals this project would have never been done completed properly
